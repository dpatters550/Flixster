### Notes

This App development was difficult to make due to my inexperience with the kotlin syntax and also my inexperience with Andriod Studio IDE. I had constantly ran into errors while working with the coding portion of this app, but visually, it was a pretty smooth process. I truly enjoy the drag and drop nature of the IDE. 

### Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading and caching library for Androids
